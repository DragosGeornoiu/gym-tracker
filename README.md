# Gym Workout Tracker

A simple web app to track and log your workouts. It allows you to select exercises, add sets with weight and reps, and commit the workout data to a GitHub repository. The data is stored in JSON files within the repo.

## Github pages

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at the following URL:
[https://dragosgeornoiu.github.io/gym-tracker/](https://dragosgeornoiu.github.io/gym-tracker/)

## Current Features
- Select exercises and add sets (with weight/reps).
- Dynamically add multiple exercises.
- Commit workout check-ins to GitHub with a token.

*This is a proof of concept and there is still a lot to do.*
